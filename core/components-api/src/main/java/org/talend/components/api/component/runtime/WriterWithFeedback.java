/**
 * In certain cases, a {@link Sink} is not the "end" of a Pipeline, but can provide records to indicate more information
 * about which writes succeeded or failed.
 * <p>
 * This looks like a transformation, but only applies to {@link Sink} runtimes. Immediately after each
 * {@link Writer#write(Object)} operation, the methods added by this interface can be called to get the list of
 * successful and rejected records. The list is only valid immediately after the write operation and will be rewritten
 * with the next "batch" on subsequent writes.
 * <p>
 * In addition, the {@link #getRejectedWrites()} is called immediately after the {@link Writer#close()} method to handle
 * any writes that might have been rejected but are not known until close is called.
 * <p>
 * The output records that an implementing component provides follow the same rules as other outputs in the component
 * framework: it is either an {@link IndexedRecord}, or provides a mechanism to convert to an {@link IndexedRecord} via
 * the {@link AvroRegistry}.
 *
 * @param <T> Type of record to be written
 * @param MainT   the type of the output records that indicate success. This can be the same as the incoming record or can
 *                be enriched with information from the write (often the unique identifier assigned to the record on write, if any).
 * @param RejectT the type of the output records that indicate failure. This can be the same as the incoming record or
 *                can be enriched with information why the record was rejected.
