/**
 * A {@link WriteOperation} defines the process of a parallel write of objects to a Sink.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code WriteOperation} defines how to perform initialization and finalization of a parallel write to a sink as well as how
 * to create a {@link Writer} object that can write a bundle to the sink.
 *
 * <p>
 * Since operations in Dataflow may be run multiple times for redundancy or fault-tolerance, the initialization and finalization
 * defined by a WriteOperation <b>must be idempotent</b>.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@code WriteOperation}s may be mutable; a {@code WriteOperation} is serialized after the call to {@code initialize} method and
 * deserialized before calls to {@code createWriter} and {@code finalized}. However, it is not reserialized after
 * {@code createWriter}, so {@code createWriter} should not mutate the state of the {@code WriteOperation}.
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@link Sink} for more detailed documentation about the process of writing to a Sink.

     *
     * <p>
     * The results that are passed to finalize are those returned by bundles that completed successfully. Although bundles may
     * have been run multiple times (for fault-tolerance), only one writer result will be passed to finalize for each bundle. An
     * implementation of finalize should perform clean up of any failed and successfully retried bundles. Note that these failed
     * bundles will not have their writer result passed to finalize, so finalize should be capable of locating any
     * temporary/partial output written by failed bundles.
     *
     * <p>
     * A best practice is to make finalize atomic. If this is impossible given the semantics of the sink, finalize should be
     * idempotent, as it may be called multiple times in the case of failure/retry or for redundancy.
